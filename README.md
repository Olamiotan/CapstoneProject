# Coursera_Capstone
This is for capstone projects for IBM Data Science Professional Certification on Coursera


Using Data Analytics skills and techniques that I have learned as part of the previous courses in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. I assumed the role of an Associate Data Analyst who has recently joined the organization and be presented with a business challenge that requires data analysis to be performed on real-world datasets. 

I undertook the tasks of collecting data from multiple sources, performing exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and preparation, statistical analysis and mining the data, creating charts and plots to visualize data, and building an interactive dashboard. The project culminated with a presentation of your data analysis report, with an executive summary for the various stakeholders in the organization. I was assessed on both your work for the various stages in the Data Analysis process, as well as the final deliverable. 

This project was a great opportunity to showcase my Data Analytics skills, and demonstrate my proficiency to potential employers.
